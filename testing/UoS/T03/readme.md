#### Three humps - Dam-break wave propagation over dry bed

This test involves a dam-break wave propagating over a 75 m Ã— 30 m domain with closed boundaries featured with three humps ([Shirvani et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfr3.12695)). The roughness is represented by a uniform Manning coefficient of 0.018. An imaginary dam along x = 16 m separates an initial water depth of 1.875 m from the rest of the domain. With the start of the simulations, the dam-break wave is expected to rapidly advance towards the downstream, reaching the two smaller humps by t = 2s and submerging them by t = 6 s. The big hump is expected to be surrounded by the wave by t = 12 s. With further propagation of the wave, the flow reaches the downstream and gradually attenuates as a result of interactions with the wall and humps. The flow settles down to reach steady state after 300 s.

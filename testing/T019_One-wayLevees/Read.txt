*N Quinn. One-way levees*

This tests the simple 'levee' addition to LISFLOOD which allows the user to increase the bankfull depth based on a grid of heights (m) that will be added to the normal calculation of SGCbfH.
Key word in the par file = SGClevee
Then specify the file - e.g. levee.asc

Note - this only works one way presently. Water will still flow into a cell containing a subgrid channel as normal, so this is NOT a true levee.
Still, this may be a better alternative to raising the DEM of a whole cell to increase SGCbfH in coastal zones (where increasing the depth is not an option) in some situations.

The test case demonstrates the difference between the 'no levees' and 'with levees' solutions in a simple idealised situation.

 #### Three humps - Modelling shallow flow with thin water layers

This test is designed to assess the stability of the DG2 solver in presense of thin water layers. It involves a 75 m Ã— 30 m domain featured with three humps with shapes defined in Liang and Borthwick (2009). An imaginary dam along x = 16 m seperates a water depth of 0.0875 m from the rest of the domain which is covered by a thin water depth of 0.0015 m. **To be updated**
